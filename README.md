# JS5-MenuApp
A simple menu app for browser


## Description

The goal was to create a menu app based on some Javascript OOP concepts like creating classes. The following guidelines had to be met:

- Use at least one array.
- Use at least two classes.
- Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

The menu app is a simple book catalog that lets a user add a new book to the library, view books in the library, and delete books from the library. This is similar to my bootstrap assignment where I based it off of an online book catalog. I referenced the videos from the lecture and walkthrough guide to complete this assignment.
