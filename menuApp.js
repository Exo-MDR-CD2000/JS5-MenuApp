/** Coding Steps:
    Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
        Use at least one array.
        Use at least two classes.
        Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

/**
 * Let's create a library app that allows users to add, view, and delete books.
 * we can add a new book by providing the title, author, year of publication, and ISBN.
 * we can view all books in the library.
 * we can delete a book by the index.
